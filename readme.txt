Progressive Enhancement with ASP.NET and React

Thanks for downloading the code sample.

Before you can run the solution you need to restore the nuget and npm packages:
1. Open and build the TodoMVC.sln to restore the nuget packages.
2. Open a command prompt, cd to the TodoMVC project folder and run "npm install" to restore the npm packages.

Happy coding. If you have any questions, get in touch @grahammendick
